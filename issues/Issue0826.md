# Issue: Bring in Other packages/crates into scope

## Synopsis

I have encountered some problems when I tried to bring in other packages.

In a nutshell, I'm wondering how to use another binary crate in the current binary crate.

## Description

The structure of my project `wordle` is like this:

`.` is the current directory `wordle`.

```

File:` ./src/f_package/src/lib.rs`

``` rust
fn f_func1() {}

pub mod f_mod1 {
  pub struct FStruct1 {}
}

pub struct FStruct2 {}
```

In `./src/solver/src/main.rs`

``` rust
fn main() {
  // snip
}

pub mod solver_mod1 {
  pub mod solver_mod2 {
    pub struct SolverStruct1 {}
  }
}
```

File: `./Cargo.toml`

I have added the two packages (or crates?) into the dependencies:

```
[dependencies]
f_package = { path = "./f_package" }
solver = { path = "./solver" }
```

File: `./src/lib.rs`

## Problems

### Problem No.1

First, I want use the `f_package` in my project `worlde`. I managed to do this by adding `use f_package` in the file `./src/main.rs` or in the file `./src/lib.rs`

File : `./src/main.rs`

Here , I want to use `./f_package`, I have to add `use::f_package;` , then I can call all the modules and structs and functions in `f_package`

``` rust
use f_package::{self,f_mod1};
// mod f_package
fn main() {
  // snip
  f_mod1::FStruct1{};
  f_package::Struct2{};
  f_package::f_func1();
}
```

Why I cannot use `mod f_package` / `mod f_package::f_mod1` to bring the `f_package`/`f_mod1` mod into the crate in my project `wordle`?



### Problem No.2

File: `./src/main.rs`

``` rust
// snip
use solver; // this line generates an error

fn main() {
  // snip
  solver::solver_mod1{};// the compiler cannot file the module
}
```



Why can't I bring in the package `solver` like `f_package` ?



### Problem No.3

Now, I declared a struct `Game` and a mod `miniwordle` in `./src/lib.rs`

File: `./src/lib.rs`

``` rust
// snip
pub struct Game {
  // snip
}

pub mod miniwordle {
  // snip
}
```



Why do I have to use `use wordle::Game` to refer to the struct `Game` in the library crate ?

Actually, there are two crates in my project `wordle` : one generated by `lib.rs`, the other generated by `main.rs`. If I want to use an item in another crate, I have to use `wordle::` to tell the compiler to find a crate tree in my project and look for the item I want ? Does the compiler know which crate I am referring to if there are two crates in one project ?

Then, how can I use another mod in `lib.rs` ? Why can't I use `mod` statement to bring that crate in `lib.rs` into the crate generated by `main.rs` ?
